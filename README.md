The 'Smart Clock' is a clock that displays time, date and weather information. It can auto change display brightness and almost everything is configurable (like 12-hour or 24-hour clock, temperature in 째C or 째F, date in days-months or months-days format and automatic or manual brightness control).  
Hardware files are made in Altium and software is written in C++.

![Smart Clock](/thumbnail.png?raw=true "Smart Clock")

'Smart Clock' is a project I started years ago with an idea for my Arduino Nano after seeing [this](https://www.instructables.com/id/Making-a-Wooden-LED-Clock/) project. I got the basics to work but wanted to expand and improve on this idea.
A lot more was possible with wifi integration on the ESP32, so that's what made me pick up this project again. I'm most interested in hardware (that's also what I studied) but during this project I learned a lot about C++ in general, so it was a good learning experience. I know the code can get a lot cleaner if I remove some global vars and structure some things a bit different, but I found a lot of that out while already being pretty far into the project. Maybe something to change in the future, but not for now.

## Features
I called this project 'Smart Clock' but what does this exactly mean for this project? The clock is 'smart' in a way that it does a lot of things automatically, without the need of any user input. This results to the following features: 
- Displaying time and weather information   
Of course, the most important feature of a clock: Displaying the time. Besides displaying time, the Smart Clock can display date, temperature, humidity and time with date in binary (when enabled and always in 24H format).   
   
   ![Different modes gif]()   

- Automatic network configuration:   
The clock can automatically connect to a saved wifi network. When there is no network configured, it sets up its own network to connect to via your PC, tablet or phone. A new wifi connection can be configured in the portal that shows up after connecting. The settings of the clock can also be configured in this portal as shown below:   
   
   ![Configuration portal](/pictures/portal.png?raw=true "Configuration portal")   

- As shown in the portal, the clock has a lot of different settings:
   - **Auto brightness**: Automatically change the brightness of the matrix display depending on the light level in the room. This can also be manually controlled with the buttons on top of the clock (this will disable auto brightness and can be enabled again by holding the '+' button). Sensitivity can be adjusted in software, and with the potentiometer on the PCB.
   - **Auto cycling**: Auto cycle between the different screens like time, date and weather information. This can also be manually done by pressing the middle button on the clock. Doing this will disable auto cycling. To enable this again, hold the '-' button.
   - **Clock format**: Choose between 12-hour or 24-hour clock format.
   - **Date format**: Choose between Day-Month format or Month-Day format.
   - **Temperature unit**: Choose between 째F or 째C. 
   - **City/Country**: Get accurate weather information from your specified location. Check the available locations and valid format [here](https://openweathermap.org/).
- The clock automatically changes to DST when this is applicable for your location (automatically detected). 
- The RTC is synced with the web. This means if for some reason the RTC gets out of sync, the right time is set based on your [IP/location](http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip).

See comments in source files for the explanation of the code. If you have any questions about the code, or anything else, you can make an [issue](https://github.com/noelvissers/esp32-smart-clock/issues) and I'll try to answer it as soon as I can.

## Hardware
The whole project is built on the ESP32. The board I used is the [ESP32-DevKitC V4](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html). This microcontroller is easy to use (uses the Arduino framework) and has built-in bluetooth and wifi connectivity. This controller also has two cores which is very useful in some situations.

- \+ Other various components like resistors and capacitors (see schematic).

The electronics for this project are fairly simple. I choose to use TH components instead of SMD components (and in some cases breakout boards) since these are easier to solder and replace by hand. Since this is meant as a prototype, a later version would include SMD components, no breakout or developer boards and probably JTAG programming. But this is out of my scope for this project.   

### Circuits
Below are the hardware circuits for the clock explained. If you have any questions about the circuits, or anything else, you can make an [issue](https://github.com/noelvissers/esp32-smart-clock/issues) and I'll try to answer it as soon as I can.   

Below you can see the two PCB projects, since we need two PCB's to make this clock. This is becuase the display is at a different angle (see [PCB](#pcb)).   
   
![SCH](/pictures/sch_smartclock.png?raw=true "SCH")   
   
Below you can see the schematic (blocks) for the main board. This is where most components are (outside the display). The buttons, RTC and LDR are all connected to the microcontroller, the ESP32, and the microcontroller is connected to the header that connects to the display PCB. X1 is just there for support. Note that there is no power input anywhere in these schematics. The power comes from the ESP32's USB port. This will be showed later in the mechanical design.   
   
![SCH base board](/pictures/sch_mainboard.png?raw=true "SCH base board")  
#### ESP32
This is the heart of the clock; the microcontroller a.k.a. the ESP32. Since it the operating voltage of the microcontroller is 3.3V, the normal 5V USB voltage won't be suited. On the devkit there is a voltage regulator to bring down the 5V to 3.3V, but there is still a pin we can use that is connected to the 5V input. This means we can drive the 5V display from this USB power. For the data lines we need a level shifter (U1001). This means the ESP can send on 3.3V and the MAX7219 will receive this as 5V. 
   
![ESP32](/pictures/sch_esp32.png?raw=true "ESP32")   

#### Buttons
For the buttons I used a simple debounce circuit. In testing I found out that this sometimes doesn't filter out all the bouncing, so this is also handled in software. This could be because of bad buttons or wrong resistor/capacitor values, but the solution I found in software with interrupts works very smooth right now. Having a pull-up resistor to 3.3V means the button is active LOW.   
   
![Buttons schematic](/pictures/sch_button.png?raw=true "Buttons schematic")   

#### RTC
To keep track of the time, even when the clock is powered off, we need a RTC. The DS3231 RTC used in this project communicates via I2C. This means we need 4 pins connected to the ESP: SDA, SCL and GND/VCC. The DS3231 has a [typical input voltage of 3.3V](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS3231.pdf) which is perfect since the ESP runs on 3.3V. This also means there is no level shifter needed for the data and clock lines. Since the ESP32 has dedicated I2C pins, we can use these to communicate with the RTC. These are pin IO21 (SDA) and IO21 (SCL).   
   
![RTC schematic](/pictures/sch_rtc.png?raw=true "RTC schematic")   

#### LDR
This is a simple voltage divider. The resistance of the LDR changes depending on the light level; more light means less resistance. This means the voltage to the analog input of the ESP changes; a higher voltage level with more light, a lower voltage level with less light. The sensitivity can be set with the potentiometer. Since this is an analog output, we need to make sure it is connected to an analog input on the ESP so we can use the ADC from the ESP to read this value.    
   
![LDR schematic](/pictures/sch_ldr.png?raw=true "LDR schematic")   

#### Display
The dot matrix displays are powered via the [MAX7219 display driver](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX7219-MAX7221.pdf) on 5V. Since the ESP developer board is powered by USB (5V), we can use the input voltage of the board to power the MAX7219. The other parts of ESP run on 3.3V, so we need a level shifter for the 3 data lines: D<sub>IN</sub>, CS and CLK. The CS and CLK lines go to both display 1 and 2, while the data line (D<sub>IN</sub>) only goes to display 1. The MAX7219 has a data out (D<sub>OUT</sub>) pin that can be connected to the data in pin of display 1. This way we can daisy chain the displays together.   
The I<sub>SET</sub> resistor sets the maximal current for the display. This means you will get less brightness with a higher resistor value. I found that the typical circuit that uses around 10kOhm is way too bright, especially at night. You might want to experiment with this a bit and see what value you prefer. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4PSEJzVU0) you can see the effect of different resistor values, although a camera always tries to compensate for this light level. This video does however give a good indication of the minimum brightness. I used a 100k potentiometer in series with the recommended 10k resistor, so I can tweak it after assembly, where 10k is too bright and 100k (or 110k in this case) is probably too dark. So somewhere in the middle should be the sweat spot.   
   
![Display schematic](/pictures/sch_display.png?raw=true "Display schematic")   

### Testing
Testing all the hardware (and also software). This is to check if all the circuits work as intented.   
   
![Breadboard testing](/pictures/breadboard_test.png?raw=true "Breadboard testing")   
   
As you can see, the right display has a different brightness. During the testing phase, I found out the display can actually get pretty bright and also blinding. So I expirimented with different resistor values.

### PCB
Below you can see (from left to right) the top, front and side view of the PCB.   
   
![PCB](/pictures/pcb_layout.png?raw=true "PCB")   
   
The gerber files to order the PCB are located in the designated hardware folder.
   
## Case
To see what would go where (on the PCB as well as the mechanical design) I created a [mechanical sketch](/pictures/mch_sketch.png) (yes, in paint).   
   
After this, I could make the PCB and a real mechanical drawing to figure out actual sizes of the case:   
   
![MCH design](/pictures/smart-clock.gif?raw=true "MCH design")   
   
After I was happy with how everything turned out, I rendered the image to get a clear view of what the end result would be like:   
   
![3D render](/pictures/3d_sketch.png?raw=true "3D render")   
   
Note that there is a 8x18 grid of holes in the case, while the display is only 8x16 pixels. This (in my opinion) looks better if a digit is displayed on the edge of the display.
   
After having all the files, the PCB, all hardware components, and the software done, it was time to finish this project (v1). 

### End result
![Result](/pictures/result.png?raw=true "Result")   

## Wish list
These are features I don't expect to implement in this version, but that could be nice for a future update.
- [x] Have wifi configurable and not hard-coded.  
- [ ] Have all the components (SMD) on 1 PCB so the whole thing can be a lot smaller. This also means not using an ESP32 dev. kit (or any USB interface at all).  
- [ ] Have an app or better online portal to configure all the settings, whenever you want (not only on startup).  
- [ ] Auto detect location to configure weather or use location from app.
- [ ] Add audio support to add alarms/mp3 playback via app.   
- [ ] Add RGB display and/or more displays, to be able to implement more features (like LaMetric Time).
- [ ] Clean up the code a lot.   
   
Feel free to submit any issues and/or pull requests if you have new idea's or run into issues. Of course, you are also free to implement idea's I mentioned.
